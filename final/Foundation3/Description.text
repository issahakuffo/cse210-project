Event Planning Program Description

The "Inheritance with Event Planning" program is designed for an event planning company to efficiently 
manage and market various types of events worldwide. Using object-oriented programming principles, 
including inheritance and encapsulation, the program tracks lectures, receptions, and outdoor gatherings by 
creating a base Event class and derived classes for each event type. With a focus on code reusability, 
the program ensures shared attributes and methods are inherited, while encapsulation maintains data integrity.
 The program allows for the creation of events with essential details such as title, description, date, time, 
 and address, and provides functionality to generate three types of marketing messages: standard details, 
 full details (including event-specific information like speaker name and capacity for lectures, RSVP email 
 for receptions, and weather forecast for outdoor gatherings), and short descriptions. By adhering to the 
 specified program requirements and utilizing an address class for addresses, the program efficiently 
 produces marketing material for distribution on social media platforms.
